# The Mortician

Tips<br/>
• Use Shooting Star immediately after Crashing Comet to quickly traverse long distances.<br/>
• Get a Wax Quail.<br/>
• Gun Sling can be used to cancel your downwards momentum.

## Planned Updates

• Mastery skin
• Logbook entry
• Fix animation smoothing issue
• Add more VFX for pretty much everything
• Add more custom SFX
• Remake icons for Gun Sling and Shooting Star
• Add SFX to lobby intro animation
• General animation polishing

Unless I get a sudden flash of inspiration, I have no plans to make additional alt skills.

## DISCLAIMER

In the case that this mod becomes deprecated or unplayable, and I have completely disappeared for an extended period of time and cannot be contacted, I grant full permission to update and maintain this mod to anybody who wishes to do so, as long as proper credit is given to myself and all others who have worked on Mortician. I will do my best to keep the github repo updated with all the latest project files.
