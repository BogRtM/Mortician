I did some multiplayer testing internally, but I cannot say with 100% certainty that he works fine in multiplayer. If you play as a client, you will experience some latency, but otherwise please contact me if you encounter any game-breaking bugs. Morticians in multiplayer should be able to hit and sacrifice each other's ghouls, but let me know if that isn't the case.

Also I'm not 100% decided on Tombstone's functionality. There may be a _slight_ chance in the future that it gets reworked. Probably not, though.

Ghouls are missing a lot of SFX until I get someone to voice act them. Also they can proc Ghor's Tome and drop lunar coins; I'll definitely fix this, so enjoy it while it lasts.

# The Mortician
I was listening to Spotify one day when the song [Till Death Us Do Part (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V8fJqamOsE) by Lord Of The Lost came on. I already vaguely had an idea for a necromancer survivor, but that song gave me a sudden flash of inspiration, and immediately popped a more concrete idea into my head. I knew I had to act on it.

So yeah, Mortician was born almost entirely from this one song; if you play him, you gotta listen to it.

Also try [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj0ItzIlnJ4) song too.

Actually just make yourself a playlist with Lord Of The Lost, Gothminister, and Deathstars, because that was pretty much all I listened to while making this guy.

**Tips**<br/>
• Ghouls hit by your shovel will be launched in the direction that you are facing. You can influence the angle by looking up or down.<br/>
• Ghouls don't inherit your items, but they do proc your on-hit effects, and any kill they earn will belong to you.<br/>
• Unlike ghouls, your tombstone does inherit your items.
