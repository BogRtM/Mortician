# I NEED YOUR FEEDBACK
If you play as a client, you will experience some latency as well as warning spam in the console (I am working to fix this), but otherwise please contact me (bog4770 on Discord) if you encounter any game-breaking bugs.

Also I'm not 100% decided on Tombstone's functionality. There may be a _slight_ chance in the future that it gets reworked. Probably not, though.

Ghouls are missing a lot of SFX until I get someone to voice act them. Also they can proc Ghor's Tome and drop lunar coins; I'll definitely fix this, so enjoy it while it lasts.

# The Mortician
I was listening to Spotify one day when the song [Till Death Us Do Part (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V8fJqamOsE) by Lord Of The Lost came on. I already vaguely had an idea for a necromancer survivor, but that song gave me a sudden flash of inspiration, and immediately popped a more concrete idea into my head. I knew I had to act on it.

So yeah, Mortician was born almost entirely from this one song; if you play him, you gotta listen to it.

Also try [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj0ItzIlnJ4) song too.

Actually just make yourself a playlist with Lord Of The Lost, Gothminister, and Deathstars, because that was pretty much all I listened to while making this guy.

**Tips**<br/>
• Ghouls hit by your shovel will be launched in the direction that you are facing. You can influence the angle by looking up or down.<br/>
• Ghouls don't inherit your items, but they do proc your on-hit effects, and any kill they earn will belong to you.<br/>
• Unlike ghouls, your tombstone does inherit your items.<br/>
~~Also I know he's overpowered as shit any semblance of balance is out the window~~
