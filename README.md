# I NEED YOUR FEEDBACK
I did some multiplayer testing internally, but I cannot say with 100% certainty that he works fine in multiplayer. If you play as a client, you will experience some latency, but please let me know if you encounter any game-breaking bugs.

Also I'm not 100% decided on Tombstone's functionality. There may be a _slight_ chance in the future that it gets reworked. Probably not, though.

# The Mortician
I was listening to Spotify one day when the song [Till Death Us Do Part (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V8fJqamOsE) by Lord Of The Lost came on. I instantly got the idea for a necromancer character who you could play while listening to that song.

So yeah, Mortician was born entirely from that one song; if you play him, you gotta listen to it.

Actually just make yourself a playlist with Lord Of The Lost, Gothminister, and Deathstars while playing him because that was pretty much all I listened to while making this guy.

Tips<br/>
• Use Shooting Star immediately after Crashing Comet to quickly traverse long distances.<br/>
• Get a Wax Quail.<br/>
• Gun Sling can be used to cancel your downwards momentum.
